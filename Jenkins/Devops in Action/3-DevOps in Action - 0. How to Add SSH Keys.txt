# In order to use an SSH key with Git, you must first create the key on your computer. If you already have an SSH key, you can skip these steps. In order to check if you have a key, you can run this command:
ssh-add -l

#Follow along with the steps below to create the key and copy its contents. You will need to open your computerâ€™s default terminal application.
#Open the terminal app on your computer
#Enter the following command
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<youremailaddress>"

#Press Enter to accept the default file location
#Enter a secure passphrase and Press Enter

#Enter this command to display the contents of your public key
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the contents of your key to your clipboard (we will need it later)
